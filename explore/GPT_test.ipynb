There has been interval increase in the now moderate-sized right- sided pleural effusion. Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Mild cardiomegaly is stable. There are increased interstitial markings suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion. The left lung fields are clear. There is no pneumothorax. The osseous structures are unremarkable. Interval increase in now moderate-sized right pleural effusion and worsening CHF. Underlying consolidation cannot be excluded. Sinus bradycardia, rate 53. Left anterior hemiblock.

FINAL REPORT 71-year-old female with history of cirrhosis secondary to NASH and acetaminophen toxicity now with change in mental status suspected secondary to hepatic encephalopathy. Referred for assessment of ascites. Abdominal ultrasound and CT abdomen and pelvis . Focused grayscale ultrasound scanning was performed in the four abdominal quadrants to assess for ascites.

She responded well to fluids.. 2 Mental status changes: most likely secondary to hepatic encephalopathy for which the patient has had repeated admissions. Patient also has positive urine culture for what is felt to be a colonizer per ID no need to treat. Patient placed on lactulose for bowel movements per day, continued of rifaximin. Blood cultures negative except for one that was felt to be a contaminant. Alert and oriented 3 at discharge. If additional admissions, likely will be due to noncompliance as discussion with family revealed lactulose titrated to one bowel movement daily. Family educated that patient need more bowel movements per day given her liver function.. 3 Urinary Tract Infection: Vancomycin- resistant Enterococcus felt to be colonizer due to poor urine output in this patient with End Stage Renal Disease. Patient was given 2 doses of daptomycin, but ID felt if colonizer no need to treat.. 4 Effusion: likely chronic from cirrhosis. No urgency to tap.. 5 Cirrhosis NASH: increasing ascites. Continued rifaximin, ursodiol, lactulose. Stopped lasix in setting of hypotension and patient on HD for fluid control.. 6 ESRD on HD: HD on M W F.

The patient is currently on hemodialysis and receiving medical management for various comorbidities including liver failure, UTI, and C-difficile infection. She is being monitored for fluid status and hemodynamic stability, with plans for continued hemodialysis and possible PICC line placement.
